# EXPLANATION

# In your Streamlit code, you use `args` to pass arguments to the callback function `increment_counter` when the button is clicked. Here's a breakdown of why this is necessary:

### Explanation of `args`

# 1. **Callback Functionality**: When you set a button to call a function upon being clicked (like `increment_counter`), Streamlit needs a way to pass any required parameters to that function. 

# 2. **Passing Arguments**: By using `args=(increment_value,)`, you're telling Streamlit to pass the current value of `increment_value` (which is taken from the number input) to the `increment_counter` function. 

# 3. **Dynamic Input**: If the button were to call `increment_counter` without passing any arguments, the function would not know how much to increment `count` by. The `args` tuple allows you to customize the value based on user input every time the button is clicked.

### Example Breakdown

# Here's your key snippet for clarity:

# ```python
# increment = st.button('Increment', on_click=increment_counter,
#     args=(increment_value,))
# ```

# - `on_click=increment_counter`: Specifies the function to be called when the button is clicked.
# - `args=(increment_value,)`: The current value of `increment_value` will be passed to `increment_counter` as an argument.

# ### Conclusion

# This setup allows `increment_counter` to operate based on the most recent user input. If you didn’t use `args`, the function wouldn't have access to the user’s input and would not be able to increment the count correctly.
